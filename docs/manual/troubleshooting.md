Common problems and rebuilding the sound banks.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|
| "MIDI access denied" | Click the icon left of the address bar → MIDI devices → Allow, then reload. |
| "Port unavailable" | Another app (Ableton, FL Studio…) is using the APC. On Windows a MIDI port cannot be shared, so close that app and reload. |
| Detected but pads do nothing | Unplug the APC, wait 10 seconds, plug it into another USB port, then reload. Windows' MIDI service can stop delivering input after sleep or hot-plugging. |
| No sound | Click **Start** first: browsers block audio until a click. |
| A new sound bank does not appear | Restart `start.bat` / `start.sh`, then reload. New library banks go to their planned bank if it is empty, otherwise to the first empty bank (a message tells you which). |
| See what the APC sends | Open the **MIDI monitor** plugin. |
| The visualizer's projector window does not open | The browser blocked the pop-up: allow pop-ups for this page (icon in the address bar), then click **Projector** again. |

## Rebuilding the sound banks (optional)

The `sounds/` folder is already included. To regenerate it, for example at another tempo:

```bash
python -m venv tools/.venv
tools/.venv/Scripts/pip install -r tools/requirements.txt    # Windows
# tools/.venv/bin/pip install -r tools/requirements.txt      # macOS / Linux
tools/.venv/Scripts/python tools/build_banks.py --bpm 128 --gabber-bpm 200
```

The script works in two parts:
- **CC0 samples**: it downloads the Sonic Pi samples, trims silence and normalises levels. For loops, it detects the tempo, time-stretches them to the target tempo without changing pitch (WSOLA) and cuts them to an exact number of bars.
- **Gabber, Hardcore, Oldschool, Mainstream and New wave banks**: it synthesises them from scratch (`tools/gabber.py`).

After regenerating, click **Reset** in the app (the circular arrow at the right of the header).
